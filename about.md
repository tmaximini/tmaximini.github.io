My expertise is web development, both frontend and backend. I love writing Javascript, HTML5, Sass, etc. I enjoy picking up new technologies, though it is impossible to follow everything at the current pace in web dev world.

I enjoy all things Javascript, from Angular and React on the front-end to Express and MongoDB on the backend and Ionic / Cordova for mobile apps.

Although I always try to stay up to date with the latest web technologies I strongly value the right tool for the right job over the latest alpha of hype.js.

When not programming, you can find me hanging out with my friends, traveling with my girlfriend or producing music in the studio.
Feel free to contact me if you want to work with me or just talk web dev, I am always interested in exciting projects.
